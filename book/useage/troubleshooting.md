# Troubleshooting jobs on HPC

Sometimes things go wrong when we use HPC. This is a fact of life. This can be for many reasons, sometimes it can be HPC related, sometimes it might be to do more specifically with the code you're running.

```{note}
Whilst the Research Computing team provide support for the HPC we can't troubleshoot specific problems you might have with individual languages or scientific software packages. In those cases we'll advise you to speak to your supervisor or contact the original developers for support.

This page will aim to cover some of the most common problems people encounter when using the HPC and provide you with the tools you'll need to fix things or in some cases work out what's going wrong.
