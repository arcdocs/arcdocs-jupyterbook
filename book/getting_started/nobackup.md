# Storage on HPC

## HOME directory

When you log into the either ARC3 or ARC4 you automatically start in your user area or HOME directory. This offers a dedicated, weekly backed up space for file storage that is shared across both HPC systems. Your HOME directory is limited to 10GB per user so its important to avoid using this space as a destination for data generated by cluster jobs, as home directories fill up quickly and exceeding your quota will cause your jobs to fail.

You can always check how much of your quota you're using with the `quota` command:

```bash
$ quota -s
Disk quotas for user medacola:
     Filesystem   space   quota   limit   grace   files   quota   limit   grace
nas-ufaservn1:/export/home/home01
                  7897M  10240M  11264M           25194       0       0

```

In the above case I've used the `quota -s` command to get a human readable output. It shows I've used 7897MB (7.9GB) in the space column, with a quota of 10240MB (10GB) and a hard limit of 11264MB (11GB).
