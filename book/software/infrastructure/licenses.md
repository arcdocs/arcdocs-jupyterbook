# Licences

The licenses module is a special module added by default that includes general licence information for common applications on the HPC.

```{note}
For some specific application you will be required to request from your supervisor additional licence information so that it can be used on the HPC. Please consult an applications specific [software page](../..\software\start.md) for more information.
