# Licenses

The licenses module is a special module loaded by default that includes general license information for common applications on the HPC.

```{note}
For some specific application you will be required to request from your supervisor additional license information so that it can be used on the HPC. Please consult an applications specific [software page](../../software/start.md) for more information.
