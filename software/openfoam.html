<p>OpenFOAM is an open-source set of C++ based command tools which can be
used to perform Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations, it is entirely
based inside the terminal and has no direct user interface.<br />
Results from the simulations can be viewed by running the command:
[paraFoam]{.lang:default .decode:true .crayon-inline} to launch an
external viewing application.<br />
This wiki will run through how to set up a case for running OpenFoam, as
well as listing some of the basic tips on performing a simulation
without error, primarily using the software available inside Mechanical
Engineering.</p>

<p>An OpenFoam case will consist of 3 separate directories:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>The ‘0’ time folder, this is where the files which contain the
boundary and initial conditions for each of the variables being
calculated are stored.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘constant’ folder, this contains the transport properties
ditionary, the settings for the particular RANS/LES model being used
and the ‘polymesh’ folder which stores the blockMesh file used in
the mesh creation stage.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘system’ folder, which contains the control dictionary which
handles the time step and solver settings and the files used to
control the solver schemes and tolerances of the variables.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Before setting up any of the fields or solver settings, it is important
to understand which type of solver your particular case will require.
OpenFoam has several different types of solvers, a complete list of
which can be found inside the user guide at:<br />
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.openfoam.com/documentation/">http://www.openfoam.com/documentation/</a></p>
<p>Useful information on how to install the required modules and the
submission of scripts to the queuing system can be found at the bottom

<h2>[Building the computational domain:]{#Building_the_computational_domain}<a class="headerlink" href="#building-the-computational-domain-building-the-computational-domain" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you have decided which solver will be best for your particular
case, the first thing to do is to create the computational domain and
mesh it.<br />
There are two ways to go about this, the first is to use OpenFoams own
application, blockmesh and the second is to import a file meshed using
an external piece of software which can then be converted for use with
OpenFoam.</p>
<p><strong>BlockMesh:</strong> In my personal experience with blockMesh, it is both
time-consuming and difficult to understand when starting out with this
software. The lack of any kind of visual interface means that even the
simplest errors are difficult to spot without viewing your mesh in an
application such as paraFoam, the way in which the blocks of the mesh
are defined can be found in the userguide and are not too taxing for
simple and small geometries, however when modelling more complex shapes
with small details requires far more effort.</p>
<p>The blockMesh file is located in the ‘polymesh’ directory of the
‘constant’ folder in the openFoam case, to build the mesh, simple type
the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>blockMesh 
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>into the terminal at the top of your case directory e.g. where you can
see the 0, constant and system folders. This will automatically create
your mesh which can then be viewed inside paraFoam. To check the quality
of the mesh, type in the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>checkMesh 
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>this will give you an overview of the mesh including cell numbers, types
and any errors which may have occured during the building process or
which may affect the simulation.</p>
<p><strong>Importing a mesh:</strong> There are many other mesh generation applications
or priograms available to choose from, some are opensource such as gmesh
whilst others are part of a consumer software package such as Fluent’s
ICEM. OpenFoam has a wide range of tools from which you can import
meshes from many of the more well-known cfd packages available on the
market. In this case, I will be following an example which can be
performed using software available in Mechanical enginnering, although
the process is much the same for any combination of programs.</p>
<p>It is important to know the exact dimensions of the geometry you wish to
use for your case including where the main features lie such as inlets,
outlets and which faces are solid walls. Once you know this, open a new
drawing file inside a conveneient CAD program, in this case it will be
solidWorks. Begin by sketching the base of your computational domain,
this flat plane sketch will be extruded into a 3-dimensional shape later
on. If you have inlets which do not run the full width of the domain
e.g. only half of a face, or a particular shape e.g. circle, these will
need to be defined separately to the outer layer of the domain. Note
that for features such as circular inlets on a round face, you cannot
use a hole but rather define it as a cylinder and build the rest of the
profile around it until the desired shape is achieved. In order for a
boundary condition to be assigned later on, each feature must be a face
of the geometry.</p>
<p>Once the flat sketch has been completed, you can extrude each section to
the required height, however you must <strong>not</strong> select the option to merge
the extrudes together otherwise this will just create a single shape and
any features such as smaller inlets or circiles will disappear entirely.
From this point any more complex features such as rounding or tapering,
etc can be performed until you have satisfactory representation of your
geometry and all its impoertant features. Save this file as a solidworks
part and close the application. Check all measurements are correct
before saving the part as you will <strong>not</strong> be able to come back and
alter them from this point on without some difficulty.</p>
<p>Next open ICEM which can be found in the ANSYS-13.0 directory, select
file on the top taskbar and find the ‘workbench readers’ option for
importing a file; simply attempting to open/import the file by normal
means will return an empty directory. Load the model through ‘workbench
readers’ and selecting the file type to look for as ‘solidworks part’.
This will then appear on the main screen inside ICEM. Tutorials on how
to use ICEM can be found under the ‘help’ taskbar and will guide you
through how to effectively mesh your model.</p>
<p>The guidelines to ensure that your model is ready for importing to
OpenFoam are as follows:</p>
<ol class="simple">
<li><p>Does every face have the correct name assigned to it e.g. inlet,
outlet, walls, etc?</p></li>
<li><p>Has the mesh been blocked correctly?</p></li>
<li><p>Has sufficient density been selected for your simulation?</p></li>
<li><p>Have all pre-mesh checks been passed including quality histograms,
etc?</p></li>
</ol>
<p>If your geometry is meshed to the correct standard then it can be
exported for use in OpenFoam, there is an optional step to set the
boundary conditions at this stage as you can perform this task once the
mesh is in OpenFoam format. but it may be easier to set up at this
stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-boundary-conditions-for-export-and-changing-filetype-setting-boundary-conditions-for-export-and-changing-filetype">
<h2>[Setting boundary conditions for export and changing filetype]{#Setting_boundary_conditions_for_export_and_changing_filetype}<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-boundary-conditions-for-export-and-changing-filetype-setting-boundary-conditions-for-export-and-changing-filetype" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>From the taskbar in ICEM, select the ‘boundary conditions’ option under
x and assign each feature the appropriate condition e.g. pressureOutlet,
velocityInlet, solidWall, etc, these conditions will be passed through
to openFoam along with the model geometry and mesh, this means that the
initial conditions files in the ‘0’ directory will be set up ready for
use and should not require any alteration after this point.</p>
<p>To save your model ready for export, it must be in the Fluent_V6
format, solver settings and the like can remain at default and there is
no need to check any additional options in the save boxes. This single
model file can now be transferred into your OpenFoam case directory. To
convert the file for use, type the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>fluent3DMeshToFoam
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>It is a good idea at this point to run checkMesh to ensure that the
process has gone smoothly and there have been no errors which may affect
the simulation. This mesh can now be viewed in paraFoam.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="control-dictionary-settings-control-dictionary-settings">
<h2>[Control dictionary settings]{#Control_dictionary_settings}<a class="headerlink" href="#control-dictionary-settings-control-dictionary-settings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the geometry has been set up, either by importing or manual
generation, the settings for the case need attention. What solver you
are using for the case must be entered in the controlDict file located
in the “system” folder. This will typically be the first line underneath
the header, a practical example of this can be found in the tutorials
section of the OpenFoam installation (tutorials can be viewed on your
own local installation). Most of the other settings in the controlDict
file can remain untouched however should you want to alter the timestep
and how often the results of t your simulation are written to disk, the
following options will be of interest:</p>
<p><strong>deltaT</strong> – this controls the timestep and is how much time elapses in
seconds between each set of calculations performed. A lower timestep
results in far better accuracy but takes longer to run, a reasonable
value to begin with is 1e-04 or 1e-05. As a rule of thumb, an estimated
value can be (1/Reynolds Number of the flow).</p>
<p><strong>writeControl</strong> – there are two settings for this option, either:
runTime or timeStep. runTime means that the writeInterval is specified
in seconds and the given value will be how long, in seconds, it will be
between each set of results written to disk. e.g. if deltaT is set to
1e-05 and writeInterval is set to 1e-04, the results will be written to
disk every 10 steps. timeStep will mean that an integer should be
specified as to how many steps it will be between each recording e.g. a
value of 3 will write the results every 3rd timestep.</p>
<p><strong>writeInterval</strong> – the steps/time between each set of results being
written to disk.</p>
<p>There is one final option which may be relevant when moving into
compiling your own or modifying solvers and models, in order to add your
files to the directory so that they can be recognised by OpenFOAM, the
following line must be added into the controlDict below the
runTimeModifiable line:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>libs (&quot;libs.so&quot;)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where “relevant extension” leads to the correct library for the
application e.g. libsuserRAS.so, for your own compiled RAS turbulence
models.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ras-les-properties-and-transportdict-rasles-properties-and-transportdict">
<h2>[RAS/LES properties and transportDict.]{#RASLES_properties_and_transportDict}<a class="headerlink" href="#ras-les-properties-and-transportdict-rasles-properties-and-transportdict" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Depending upon whether you are using a RAS or LES based models, there
are several files which must be present in the “constant” folder. The
first of the these is general to either type of case and is called
“transportDict”. This contains the properties for the type of transport
model relevant to the solver and the required properties of the fluid
under examination. e.g. a simple example for a newtonian model requires
the kinematic viscosity property in order to run:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>transportModel Newtonian;

nu                    nu [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 15.345e-6
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The type of model must be specified along with the name of the fluid
property, its correct dimensionSet and a value. The dimensionSet allows
OpenFOAm to determine the units of the quantity in question.</p>
<p>The second file will either be: RASProperties or LESProperties depending
upon the type of simulation required, in essence they accomplish the
same job which is to identify which model should be used with the solver
along with any required coefficients not present elsewhere in the code.
A typical file structure will be as follows:</p>
<div class="section" id="rasproperties-rasproperties">
<h3>[RASProperties:]{#RASProperties}<a class="headerlink" href="#rasproperties-rasproperties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>RASModel          kOmegaSST
printcoeffs          off;
turbulence          on;
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lesproperties-lesproperties">
<h3>[LESProperties:]{#LESProperties}<a class="headerlink" href="#lesproperties-lesproperties" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>LESModel            Smagornisky;
printCoeffs           off;
delta                    vanDriest;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The option to turn off turbulence is only present in the RAS Model as
this will run in a laminar state disregarding all turbulent calculations
within the solver. The deltas option in LES allows the user to define
which settings to use with the solver, other options include: prandtl,
CubeRootVol and smoothCoeffs depending upon what is necessary for the
LES simulation. Note that for other types of solvers, files representing
the details of which chemical models/combustion properties may also be
required for the case to be set up correctly; these are just two
examples of the more common problems which may be encountered.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="fvschemes-and-fvsolutions-fvschemes-and-fvsolutions">
<h2>[fvSchemes and fvSolutions]{#fvSchemes_and_fvSolutions}<a class="headerlink" href="#fvschemes-and-fvsolutions-fvschemes-and-fvsolutions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Before the setting up of the boundary and initial conditions for each of
the fields to be solved, they must be declared and assigned a solver
scheme along with any required model settings.<br />
The <strong>fvSchemes</strong> file contains the schemes which will be used to solve
the model equations and each term present in the transport equations
must be assigned a scheme. Depending upon the choice, they can improve
stability or the solution so it is important to choose an appropriate
scheme for the term being solved. If the name of the discretisation
scheme should be entered incorrectly than error will be encountered when
trying to run the simulation along with a list of the available
schemes.<br />
The <strong>fvSolution</strong> file contains the solver scheme, preconditioner and
tolerance for each field, alteration of these values can result in
either better or worse convergence for the solution along with its
accuracy, the tighter the tolerance, the more accurate the value but may
take longer to solve or even fail to converge properly. The other set of
commands present in the file deal with the controls relevant to the
solver such as the relaxation factors (SIMPLE) or the number of
correction steps (PISO), These controls must be set correctly for the
solver to run, in many cases, the default values can be set to those
found in the tutorials section for the relevant solver. A further rule
of thumb is that the relaxation factors for pressure and velocity (p/u)
in SIMPLE cases should total to a value of 1, frequently this is
(0.3/0.7).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="initial-fields-and-their-boundary-conditions-initial-fields-and-their-boundary-conditions">
<h2>[Initial Fields and their boundary conditions]{#Initial_Fields_and_their_boundary_conditions}<a class="headerlink" href="#initial-fields-and-their-boundary-conditions-initial-fields-and-their-boundary-conditions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the mesh has been successfully created and the settings for the
solver established along with the run-time, the initial values for all
the fields being solved need to be assigned to the appropriate location
on the model. All values for the initial time step will be located in
the time folder marked:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>0
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A typical example of the kind of information required is presented
below:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dimensions     [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ];
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is the dimensionSet where the units of the value are input. The bar
containing the zeroes represents each of the following criteria in turn:</p>
<p>[ Mass, Length, Time, Temperature, Quantity, Current, Luminous
Intensity ] all in their respective SI units, for example, if you
wanted to set the units of velocity as metres per second (m/s) the bar
would be set as</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>dimensions  [ 0 1 -1 0 0 0 0 ]
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Any unit which is not required is left as a 0. A more complete list of
dimensions and their respective units can be found inside the OpenFoam
user guide.<br />
It is worth noting that these exist to ensure that the values are
represented in the correct magnitude/units and will cause an error if
there is a mis-match between units in calculations, although it does not
affect the solution numerically, it identifies that there is an
inconsistensy which will have an effect. This dimension checking can be
turned off in the control files located in the OpenFoam installation
directory inside its control Dictionary, for a more detailed description
and advice with regards to this matter, see:
<a class="reference external" href="http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Main_FAQ#How_does_one_turn_off_the_dimensional_checking.3F">http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Main_FAQ#How_does_one_turn_off_the_dimensional_checking.3F</a><br />
.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>internalField uniform 0;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This field assigns a value to all the cells not included in any of the
boundary patches (discussed next), the keyword “uniform” means all the
cells will share the identical scalar or vector value placed after it.
Such examples will include:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>internalField uniform (10 0 0)
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Typcially used when defining a velocity, this value will assign a
magnitude of 10 to the x-direction and values of 0 to the y and z
directions. These values only come into play during the ‘0’ timestep,
after which new values for all the internal cells and the boundary
patches will be calculated. However it is still important to choose a
sensible value for each variables, frequently a value of zero can be
assigned (values such as kinetic energy in a stationary starting
environment) as a starting point which the simulation will quickly alter
in further timesteps should it be required.</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>boundaryField
{
Walls
{
type        fixedValue;
value      uniform 0;
}
}
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each patch within the model must be assigned an appropriate boundary
condition and value, typical boundary patches will include inlet(s),
outlet(s) and any solid walls on the outside of the domain. The common
boundary conditions include:</p>
<p><strong>fixedValue uniform (vector/scalar)</strong> = a single value will be assigned
to all cells included within this patch but will not change with time,
unlike the internalField cells. Example for velocity at the outer walls
of a domain is shown above.</p>
<p><strong>zeroGradient</strong> = no set value will be assigned to a cell and the value
can change with time, typically present at an outlet or domain walls.</p>
<p><strong>fixedValue 0</strong> = a value set at 0 which can be used to represent an
impermeable surface through which no flow can occur at or through.
Typically used as a setup condition for velocity at domain walls.</p>
<p>More complex boundary conditions including functions which vary with
time (e.g. pulse inlet) and gradient scales can be implemeted either
through those functions desribed in the manual/tutorial cases or through
the extra utility: swak4Foam, references to which can be found at:
<a class="reference external" href="http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib/swak4Foam">http://openfoamwiki.net/index.php/Contrib/swak4Foam</a></p>
<p>It is important to note that each field which is being solved e.g.
pressure, velocity, will require its own file in the ‘0’ time directory
before the simulation will run correctly. Attempting to run this with an
incomplete setup will provoke an error message, frequently telling the
user what is missing from the directory in question.</p>

<h2>[General advice and starting tips]{#General_advice_and_starting_tips}<a class="headerlink" href="#general-advice-and-starting-tips-general-advice-and-starting-tips" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>To begin with, run the tutorial cases (incompressible flow) for a few
time steps and then examine the results. Attempt to alter the settings
in the initial conditions for velocity/pressure to get a feel what
alterations provoke which errors or how they affect the flow.<br />
Do not try and code anything from scratch for either simple model setups
or your own solvers, try and find a tutorial case similar to what you
require, copy and paste the 3 directories over to your own folder and
alter step by step.</p>
<p>When coding your own solvers/models compile using wmake/wmake libso as
necessary and make sure to add the appropriate library to controlDict
file otherwise your files will not be recognised.<br />
The easiest to use incompressible flow solvers, depending upon
requirements are: icoFoam, pisoFoam and SimpleFoam.</p>
<p>Some compressible solvers may not be entirely complete/have a number of
errors and may require modification before correctly working, check
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/">http://www.cfd-online.com/Forums/openfoam/</a> for references/advice in
these matters.</p>
<p>Velocity should be set at uniform (0 0 0) for solid domain outer walls.</p>
<p>Values at outlets should be set at zeroGradient with the exception of
pressure, a special condition Inlet/Outlet may be required to eliminate
reverse flow in some cases.</p>
<p>Pressure should be zeroGradient except outlet when pressure gradient
throughout domain is zero.<br />
Values for kinetic energy and epsilon should be allocated a very small
value at walls (e.g. 1e-24) to improve stability.</p>
<p>A typical value of a timestep should be around 1e-04/05 seconds.</p>
<p>A finer mesh is a better mesh, coarse meshes can produce poor results.</p>
<p>Ensure that when calculating values for boundary conditions that all
units you use are in SI form and are declared as such in OpenFOAM. If
the units do not match the scale of your domain (e.g. m/s vs a domain in
mm) the results will be inaccurate.</p>
<p>An initial estimate for the length scale/turbulence intensity may be
required before certain boundary conditions can be correctly assigned a
value.</p>

<p>This can be submitted to the queuing system using:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>% qsub runfoam.sh
</pre></div>

<div class="section" id="parallel-execution-parallel-execution">
<h4>[ Parallel Execution]{#Parallel_Execution}<a class="headerlink" href="#parallel-execution-parallel-execution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If you’ve configured your OpenFOAM job to be solved in parallel, you
need to submit it differently. It uses OpenMPI under the hood, so this
is an example of a suitable submission script:</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#$ -l h_rt=00:10:00
#$ -l h_vmem=2G
#$ -l np=16
#$ -cwd -V
export MPI_BUFFER_SIZE=8192
module purge
module add bit/64 gnu openmpi test openfoam
mpirun -np $NSLOTS interFoam -parallel
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This will request 16 cores and exclusive access to the nodes. This
results in 1 node being allocated and 2GB memory per core.</p>
<p>If more memory per core is required, then reduce the number of processes
per node to split the available memory netween those active processes.
For example,</p>
<div class="highlight-none notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>#$ -l np=16,ppn=4
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Will give 16 cores as before, but this time with 4 processes per core
and so 4 nodes overall. The available memory per node (32GB) is
therefore allocated across 4 cores (ie. ppn=4) and so 8GB per node will
be allocated.
