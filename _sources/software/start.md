# Software

A large number of applications are available through the module command and can be loaded with:

```
module add
```

By default this will load the latest (highest version number) of the software available. To use a specific version number, you should explicitly state this in the module statement, so to use AMBER v12, specify:

```
module add amber/12
```

To see a full list of the available modules use:

```
module avail
```

If you require additional software or applications installing, please contact us

Alternatively, we can give you support in compiling or installing software yourself.
